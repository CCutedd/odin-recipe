        <h4>Cake</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>Â½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Butter Sauce</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt pan.</li>
            <li>Make the cake: Mix flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a large bowl. Blend in buttermilk, butter, eggs, and vanilla with an electric mixer. Beat for 3 minutes on medium speed. Pour batter into the prepared pan.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>When the cake is almost finished baking, make the butter sauce: Combine sugar, butter, water, and vanilla in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until fully melted and combined; do not boil.</li>
            <li>Remove the cake from the oven. Prick holes in the still-warm cake, then slowly pour butter sauce over the top.</li>
            <li>Let cake cool before removing from pan, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
